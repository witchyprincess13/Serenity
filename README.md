Notes on Usability Improvements â€“ Homepage Redesign

1. Improved Visual Hierarchy

âœ… Before: The original design had cluttered elements, making it difficult for users to focus on key information.
âœ… After: Used clear headings, proper spacing, and contrast to guide usersâ€™ attention effectively.

2. Enhanced Navigation

âœ… After: Introduced a simplified menu with clear categories, improving accessibility and reducing cognitive load.

3. Better Call-to-Action (CTA) Placement

âœ… After: Strategically placed CTAs with high visibility, ensuring users can take action quickly.

4. Mobile-Friendly Layout Considerations

âœ… Before: The layout was not optimized for different screen sizes.
âœ… After: Designed with a responsive structure, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops and future mobile adaptations.

5. Optimized Loading Speed

âœ… Before: The original design had heavy images and unnecessary elements, slowing down page load time.
âœ… After: Used optimized images and efficient design elements to improve performance and speed.

6. Increased Readability & Accessibility
